@Changelog
              1.0
                 + depending on which element is a parent element, script creates formLabels either as spans or labels (suggested by Alex Hall)
                 + new option 'semantic'. If true, then plugin renders label before input box (works only if labelParent:'form')
                 * 'labelParent' option supports any element on the page, but labelParent: 'form' puts labels into closest form. Default value has been changed to form. (suggested by Ferry Mulyono)
                 * changed logic for label's background detection
                 * fixed problem with blur event (formLabel did not disappear on auto-complete)
